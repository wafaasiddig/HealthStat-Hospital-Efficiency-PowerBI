Total Discharges
                    Total Discharges = COUNTROWS(hospital_discharges)
Counts the total number of hospital discharges.

Total Hospitals
                    Total Hospitals = DISTINCTCOUNT(hospital_discharges[facility_id])
Counts the total number of distinct hospitals represented in the dataset.

Average Cost per Discharge
                    Average Cost Per Discharge = DIVIDE(SUM(hospital_discharges[total_costs]),[Total Discharges])
Computes the average cost per discharge by dividing the total costs of hospital discharges by the total number of discharges.

Average LOS Days
                    Average LOS Days = AVERAGE(hospital_discharges[length_of_stay])
Computes the average length of stay (LOS) days for patients across all facilities.

% Var Average Cost per Discharge
                    % Var Average Cost per Discharge = 
                                                      DIVIDE(
                                                          ([Average Cost Per Discharge]-[Average Cost per Discharge ALL]),
                                                          [Average Cost per Discharge ALL]
                                                      )
Calculates the percentage variation in the average cost per discharge compared to the overall average cost per discharge across all facilities.

% Var Average LOS Days
                    % Var Average LOS Days = 
                                            DIVIDE(
                                                ([Average LOS Days]-[Average LOS Days ALL]),
                                                [Average LOS Days ALL]
                                            )
Calculates the percentage variation in the average length of stay (LOS) days compared to the overall average LOS days across all facilities.
